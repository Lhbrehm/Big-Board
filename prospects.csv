Rank	Name	Position	Usage	Archetype	School	Notes
1	Caleb Downs	SAF	Box/Slot		OSU	Athleticism can only be described as FREAKY, top end speed and strength that is just absurd, Ball skills to play FS, Movement skills to match WRs in man coverage, Often even used at LB at OSU due to his ability to sift through traffic and even take on blocks. Bar-none the best player I have ever scouted, he is one-of-one, and to top it all off, he is an elite punt returner. Could put on some more weight for density as he is a smaller player
2	Arch Manning	QB			Texas	Decently well built and athletic, Fast enough to be a legit tier 2 rushing threat as a QB, Elite throwing mechanics with phenominal arm talent, Struggles against chaos (zone blitzes gave him some trouble)
3	Rueben Bain Jr.	ED	3-4 DE		Miami	Thicc Lowerz, extremely strong upper body uses traditional long arm moves but was also able to execute a 'humpf' move on blake miller, consistently surprises me with his ability to get low and bend around a defender at his frame, lack of length shows up in run defense and tackling
4	Jermod McCoy	CB	Outside Only		Tennessee	Elite Press strength and technique, very good athleticism, extreme aggressiveness is a strength but can get him in trouble: 8 penalties in 2024
5	Kadyn Proctor	OT	Tackle		Alabama	Massive Build, Mauler in the run game who can move players off the ball instantly, Eliminates pass rushers when he gets his hands on them (counters very rarely work against him),  Poor foot speed and can struggle agaisnt some speed rushers (OU, Tenn, MICH)
6	Peter Woods	DL	3-Tech		Clemson	Round and bulky build, extremely strong arms, exceptional at setting picks for loopers and still managing to get free, very high IQ run defender, does not have much true pass rush ability outside the bull rush, could potentially shed some weight if that is the goal
7	John Mateer	QB			Oklahoma	Shorter and dense player with a HUGE lower half, Elite Runner, Throws like a girl (Technique: Throws from the side and leaning into the ball), Leads him to struggle getting height to the ball (deep passes and touch throws), Screens RPOs and PA heavy offense at Wazzu
8	T.J. Parker	ED	4-3 DE		Clemson	Longer edge rusher, plays with tons of power and uses arms well to shed blocks, strong run defender, lacks twitch and bend seen in elite edges and can run cold at times, most of his production came against weak competition
9	LT Overton	ED	3-4 DE		Alabama	Chunky Build, Real deal explosiveness, Consistently wins with power on the edge, versatility to play inside, doesn't currently have the bend to play on the edge full time today, lacks a true calling card as either a pass rusher or elite run defender
10	Bray Hubbard	SAF	Box/Slot		Alabama	Great at playing down hill: Very hard hitter, Good ball skills with multiple INTs, Not much man coverage in his tape
11	LaNorris Sellers	QB			S Carolina	Well built and powerful, elite runner with balance and top speed, Good mechanics and accurate passer, lacks anticipation and doesn't play on time, panicks under pressure 15 TWPs
12	Harold Perkins	LB	SAM		LSU	Undersized, but extremely twitchy athlete, newest achetype for hybrid 'positionless' defense: LB- Gets good depth when dropping in zone, has some serious quickness and speed to shut down passing lanes, quick to his spot and a good tackler, but often has to go around blocks rather than through; STAR- Lacks the technique and experience to truly play the slot especially in man coverage, however he totally has the tools and matched up on LB3 against missouri. Not a full time guy in the slot today; EDGE- Has some awesome bend and good finnesse moves (Ghost move specifically), Lacks the length and pop to exist as a full time edge rusher, even in more of a DPR role
13	Sonny Styles	LB	SAM		OSU	Former safety used all over the place, smaller build with high end movent skills, surprisingly willing to hit and take on blocks, plays with hair on fire, great in zone coverage
14	Garrett Nussmeier	QB			LSU	Smaller player, No rushing threat, Very quick release rotational thrower, not a big arm but can throw the deep ball the way Russ does, plays on time and navigates chaos well in the pocket, Lacks the special, Makes weird dumb decisions
15	Whit Weeks	LB	WILL		LSU	Thin long build, very high end mover who uses that speed to be a very good zone defender, lacks discipline in the run game and lack of mass shows up taking on blocks
16	Tyreak Sapp	ED	3-4 DE		Florida	Huge arms, built for the interior but playing outside, very versatile in alignment from A gap to wide 9, holds the point well in run defense and is able to shed blocks inside in the pass rush game, not the greatest pass rusher from the outside but has the physicals to beat guards consistently
17	Anthony Hill Jr.	LB	WILL		Texas	Long LB build, Very versatile usage, quick to diagnose plays, mastered the peanut punch (5FFM in 2 years), can play with extreme burst, good blitzer and add on rusher, Gets lost in Texas' spot drop system, against clemson he simply had no juice like he was playing hurt or something
18	Keldric Faulk	ED	3-4 DE		Auburn	Long and dense DL, maybe the most athletic DE of the bunch, Athletic enough to chase down plays, high end run defender with a nasty inside swim move, basically no real edge threat as a pass rusher or contain as a run defender, may be the auburn defense but this does not translate to the NFL
19	Joshua Josephs	ED	3-4 OLB		Tennessee	Very light with long arms, twitched up edge rusher, aggressive and powerful in the run game and can convert speed to power in the pass rush game, relentless motor with many chasedown and clean up plays, doesn't have instinctual hand usage
20	Taurean York	LB	MIKE		Texas A&M	Short but dense player, downhill personified, hits like a truck, lack of length does show in pass rush and reaching for tackles
21	C.J. Allen	LB	MIKE		Georgia	Squatty and dense build, Killer in run defense, takes on blocks very well, consistent tackler, liability in the pass game, needs to imrpove in coverage or as a blitzer to see consistent play time in the NFL
22	Arion Carter	LB	WILL		Tennessee	Very athletic LB, Very versatile usage in a chaos driven defense, Good at disrupting routes in the pass game, limited run defender that gets stuck in traffic a lot
